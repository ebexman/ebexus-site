## IV. Community Staking Participation Program

The Community Staking Participation Program enables eligible holders to engage actively with the ecosystem through optional, time-bound staking seasons. The program encourages active participation and long-term commitment rather than speculative returns.

**Eligibility and Mechanics**  
- Minimum holding requirement: **1,000 $EBEX**.  
- Season duration: **1 month** (tokens locked during this period).  
- Participation: Voluntary and open to any eligible holder.  
- Allocation per season: **100,000 $EBEX**, drawn from the 40% Community Engagement pool (total capped at 10,000,000 $EBEX).  
- Seasons: **4 per year**, ensuring controlled and predictable distribution.

**Distribution Method**  
Rewards are distributed proportionally based on each participant's staked amount relative to the total staked in the season.

**Formula**  
Participant Share = (Participant’s Staked $EBEX ÷ Total Staked $EBEX in Season) × 100,000 $EBEX
**Example**  
- Total staked in season: 20,000 $EBEX  
- Participant stakes: 1,000 $EBEX  
- Participant receives: (1,000 ÷ 20,000) × 100,000 = **5,000 $EBEX**

This example is illustrative only and does not guarantee any outcome. The program draws from a fixed Community Engagement pool to promote transparency and long-term sustainability. Participation carries inherent risks and is not a guarantee of returns. Always conduct your own research (DYOR).

## V. Roadmap
